Project Setup:

To setup the project in your own environment, please follow the following steps:

1. Please clone the repo to a directory of your choice that you have read/write access to on your computer.
2. Please ensure that package.json, .eslintrc.json, and snowpack.config.js were also cloned to your new repo as well.
3. Please make sure you have npm installed in your environment.
4. Please go into the cloned repo in your command terminal and run 'npm install'.
5. After the installation finishes, please try running 'npm run start'. If the website shows up correctly, your environment should be correctly set up.
