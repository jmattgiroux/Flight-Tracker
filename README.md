### Project Setup:

To setup the project in your own environment, please follow the following steps:

1. Please clone the repo to a directory of your choice that you have read/write
   access to on your computer.
2. Please ensure that package.json, .eslintrc.json, and snowpack.config.js were
   also cloned to your new repo as well.
3. Please make sure you have npm installed in your environment.
4. Please go into the cloned repo in your command terminal and run 'npm
   install'.
5. After the installation finishes, please try running 'npm run start'. If the
   website shows up correctly, your environment should be correctly set up.
6. If you would like, please also try running 'npm run lint' and 'npm run
   format' to make sure those scripts also work.

### Project Deployment:

1. Please go to the master branch.
2. Please confirm that it works locally by running 'npm run start'
3. Please confirm that the build version is working by running the following
   commands:
   - If on Windows, run:
     - 'Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process'
   - then
     - 'serve -s build'
   - If on Mac:
     - run 'serve -s build'
     - contact us with any issues
4. If the build version works, then please run 'npm run deploy'
5. Finally, please confirm after 10 or so minutes that the live site
   [(here)](https://jmattgiroux.github.io/Flight-Tracker/) has updated
   successfully and is working as intended.
